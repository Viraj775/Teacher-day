  <p> A teacher’s patience is shown through their willingness to address each student’s needs and challenges with understanding and calm. They allow time for students to grasp concepts, offer repeated explanations, and provide supportive feedback. This patience helps create a nurturing environment where students feel encouraged to learn and grow at their own pace.</p>
